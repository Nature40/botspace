## Introduction

This repository includes a compilation of functionalities for telegram bots developed as part of Nature 4.0.

Bot functionalities are added as modules with bot entities including modules.
Generic modules like 'start.R' will be included by every bot, as every bot needs some response to the /start commands. 

For a general introduction on the Telegram messenger, Bots or Telegram Bots enter the words 'Telegram' and 'Bot' into a search engine of your choosing and click on the first ten results.

Further manuals and tutorials will be added in the future.
